I have created Fredbot as an example of a simple AI chatbot using open source products It provides a similar function as ChaTGPT
It is written in python and easy to understand
The following products are utilised
  LLAMA 3  Large Language Model created by Meta (Facebook)
  Langchain Python library tools for handling AI prompts
  Steamlit Python tool for providing Graphical User Interface (GUI)
  Python 3 for the coding.

This app can be easily expanded to be multimodel to incorporate image and video functions.

It is free to use and modify.  Enjoy
