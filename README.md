I have created Fredbot as an example of a simple AI chatbot using open source products. It provides a similar function to ChaTGPT.
It is intended to be a learning tool coded in python and easy to understand

The following products are utilised

  LLAMA 3  Large Language Model created by Meta (Facebook) ,
  Langchain Python library tools for handling AI prompts ,
  Steamlit Python tool for providing Graphical User Interface (GUI) ,
  Python 3 for the coding.

This app can be easily expanded to be multimodal to incorporate image and video functions.

It is free to use and modify.
